## 💡 **Key Design Decisions:**

### **Why This Pricing Structure:**

1. **$4.99/month for Pro:**
   - Impulse purchase territory (<$5)
   - Comparable to Netflix, Spotify
   - Lower than Grammarly ($12/month)
   - Higher perceived value

2. **Free Tier Stays Useful:**
   - 100 checks/day is generous
   - All security features included
   - No artificial limitations
   - Builds trust and user base

3. **Business Tier ($19.99 per 5 users):**
   - $4/user/month (same as Pro)
   - But includes team features
   - Natural upgrade path
   - Targets small businesses

---

## 🎁 **Promotional Ideas (When Launching Pro):**

   - First 100 users: $99 one-time (lifetime Pro)
   - Creates urgency, $9,900 upfront revenue

## 📈 **Success Metrics to Track:**

### **Later (Paid Tiers):**

## 🛡️ **Legal Requirements (Before Payments):**
